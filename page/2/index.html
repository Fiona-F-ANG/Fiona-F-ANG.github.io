    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This is the end of my senior one. This year I studied in a famous normal senior high school, in which many of the students are preparing for Gaokao – the entrance examination of the university in China. Besides, I also prepared a lot for the A Level test. Though I cannot find a proper teacher in my city, I tried to study by myself. Here I got some ideas about the difference between British and Chinese Education System.</p>
<h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>To begin with, I would like to compare the textbooks or sessions in the two countries. </p>
<p>①<strong>Length of study</strong>: three years for Gaokao and two years for A level. </p>
<p>②<strong>Subjects</strong>: Gaokao includes Chinese, mathematics, English, physics or history, and two subjects of biology, politics, geography, and chemistry, while A-level learners choose 3-4 subjects from more than 70 subjects.</p>
<p>③<strong>Sessions</strong>: Gaokao students study all 9 subjects in the first year of high school, and choose the subjects of the high school entrance examination in the second year. A level learners study the AS course in the first year of high school, and the A2 course in the second year of high school.</p>
<p>④<strong>Allocation of knowledge in different levels</strong>: Gaokao textbooks are divided by topics of the knowledge, while A level textbooks always have all the knowledge in them, but the difficulty increases with the order of the textbooks.</p>
<h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Secondly, their ways of testing have some part in common, while there are also some different parts. As for natural science subjects, AL focus more in the interpretation of daily phenomena, while Gaokao mainly pay attention to the analysis and calculation of ideal models. However, regarding social science subjects, both of them contain multiple choice questions about the key points in the textbook and essay writing sessions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I concluded various ways of exercising according to the two system. For natural science subjects, AL learners should pay more attention to applying the knowledge from their textbooks in daily life; and of course they should also understand the sample questions in the book too. Gaokao learners need to do a lot of exercises to make sure they would not make any mistakes while analysising and calculating, and it’s better for them to summarize the types of different questions. As for the social science subjects, regardless of in which education system, students are required to accumulate a lot of reading.</p>
<hr>
<p>PS: </p>
<p>I’ve got a satisfactory score in the final exam- thanks to the special learning method which I learnt from Feynman! I would like to share the method here since it’s always so helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Determine learning goals and learn by myself.</li>
<li>Step 2: Teaching. My friend Amy and I taught each other the subjects we were good at, trying to make each other understood.</li>
<li>Step 3: Review. Reflect on the problems encountered in step 2, such as where it got stuck and where the other party did not really understand. Record these issues.</li>
<li>Step 4: Simplify. I will reorganize and understand the problems encountered, learn as much background and relevant knowledge as possible, and then re-express it in a simplified way as much as possible, trying to grasp the key points and see through the essence. Then, return to step 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am so addicted to this way of learning and reviewing that sometimes I even try it by teaching no one but me myself!</p>

        <p><strong>[1] Linguistics is a science.</strong> Linguists investigate how people acquire language-related knowledge, how this knowledge interacts with other cognitive processes, how it changes between speakers and geographic regions, and how language knowledge is modeled computationally.<br>They study how to represent the structure of various aspects of language, such as sound or meaning, how to theoretically explain different language models, and how different components of language influence each other. Linguists develop and test scientific hypotheses. Many linguists advocate the use of statistical analysis, mathematics, and logical formalism to explain the language models they observe.</p>
<p><strong>[2] Linguistics is a tool</strong>, the purpose of using which is to communicate. Just like other sciences, it describes some extremely ordinary facts, and proposes scientific hypotheses or theories to explain these facts. The apples only fall towards the ground and do not fly into the sky. Polar bears have thick fur. When we first come into contact with a language, we can quickly understand the structure, grammar, and pronunciation of the language through linguistic knowledge to communicate with others. Compared with the beautiful literary works themselves, the inherent beauty of the rules of each word, and their wonderful evolution from meaning to sound, is even more amazing.</p>
<p><strong>[3] Language is a unique way of communication for humans.</strong> It reflects the highly evolved mental abilities of human beings on the biological or psychological level, and reflects the progress of human civilization on the level. Linguistics is to study the core instinct of human language ability, through the analysis and research of spoken language, written language and even sign language, and then understand the nature of human beings.During studying I even found the connection between linguistics and other science subjects, for instance, many phenomenon that are related to difference between regions can be explained by geographic knowledge, and the process of finding the language rules always needs a lot of statistics.</p>

        <p>I.THE RECORD</p>
<p>“Have you ever lost a basketball game?”</p>
<p>Lost.<br>Lost.<br>Screaming shrilly the final whistle, the basketball slipped to the ground, as the opposing audience applauded and shouted vigorously. It bounced helplessly for several times on the red plastic track that the white sneakers had stepped on, and then lay down motionless, never waking up.</p>
<p>The net.<br>Empty.<br>I can’t wake up, an empty dream.<br>That perfect- almost illusory- air ball becomes my only and final glory.</p>
<p>The match was over.<br>It seemed, insensible.<br>That is, the sun is as dazzling as ever. It seems like every noon at which we rushed out from the classroom, it seems like every art class which we escaped through the back door, it seems like every conversation with making notes on a small book, leaving a shadow.<br>That is, there is an inexplicable impulse. It seems that it was just a cutscene in this familiar place. It seems that I used to work very hard to become a qualified power forward. It seems that I am also very desperate to take on the role of a point guard. However, when the game was over, how dare I say that, I worked hard, I tried my best.<br>That is, as Yomi said, helpless. A rebound, a tall girl, stretched out her hands. Yeah, basketball, the sport of giants. It’s ridiculous to think about dozens of shots and boards made by the opponent and only three shots from top to bottom of the team. One-third of the hit rate. Fairly high, fairly helpless.<br>That is, there is no expected frustration. It seemed suddenly, just annoyed. It seems such a familiar scene, I wondered where I have seen it, who has mentioned it, and when I have been told that I must pay attention to it.<br>That is, after the game I saw many classmates writing encouraging words for us players on the blackboard, comforting us that we have done our best. Thus I returned to the podium, picked up the chalk and prepared to write something. Suddenly, guilt slammed into the fragile flower like a heavy rain that was caught off guard, falling to pieces. It seems that I am very stubborn. It seems that I, an idealist, portrays all strategies and analyses unrealistically. It seems that I broke my promise. I played the power forward terribly. Even though I have everything in terms of steals, blocks and breakthroughs, I still can’t prevent the opponent’s short passes; I played the point guard to the ridiculous point and had no chance to use the pick-and-roll once  which I cooperated with Anna in the best. It seemed that I had tried, bravely, and scored, but it was almost meaningless. It seems that I’m sorry to the Blazers and team number I love, I’m sorry to establish the belief that we must win the Warriors. It seems that I wasted, too much precious high school time, troubling the men’s basketball players and senior sisters to teach us almost mentally handicapped skills and cooperation, receiving so many professional and unprofessional guidance, analysis and encouragement, and in the end, nothing was achieved. As if I couldn’t grasp the opportunity, the two to four score and the remaining warmth of the hollow goal deceived me. As if I thought, I still have a chance to come back and score more. I never have a chance again. Holding the chalk, it was somehow weak to write anything.</p>
<p>But my teammate Charlotte said, “Thank you for letting me participate in this grand dream.” In this grand dream, there are you, and me.</p>
<p>This grand dream–<br>Comes from disputes and boiling eyes from under the plane tree, from the sincerity of tears at the first time watching the game, from the brewing of the midsummer sunshine, from the fascination with a team and several players, and from the trembling when receiving the favorite team clothes, from the persuasive fantasy that I dare not mention about the covenant to win the championship.</p>
<p>In this grand dream–<br>There are dirty hands covered with red paint, there are two little girls that were soaked in the light rain but skipping, there are some look at their opponents and smile, and there are small groups of people who are constantly beeping for advice and discussion, confident. There are full, anxiety, discouragement. The most important one is the stability, warmth and moving when we hugged our teammates.</p>
<p>In this grand dream–<br>There are the most responsible coaches, cross-class friendly matches and the most sincere promises to meet in the final match, there are simple words which brought countless warm compliments to the little girls, there are shouts from friends on the sidelines, and there is a large box of mineral water, a camera, and photos shining under the sunlight.</p>
<p>In this grand dream–<br>The ones sitting on the court, the ones holding heads tightly, the ones behind the screen. Quietly, or presumptuously, crying. Just cry, my friends. That’s not because you can’t afford to lose, that is because you love it too much.</p>
<p>In this grand dream, I finally understand- what is basketball, what is team, and what is love.</p>
<p>It seems, it seems.<br>In a trance, a few little girls in black jerseys rub their hands, looking forward to the next game. The heavy shadows on the red track were flying lightly. And a ball, a black ball, a perfect air ball.<br>“Huh.”<br>She smiled.</p>
<p>II.THE REFLECTION</p>
<p>How to be a qualified leader? What have I done and what more can I do?</p>
<p>First, envision, which is definitely the most important quality. We have very little preparation time for the game - only less than two weeks. Thus I and two coaches (who are the men’s basketball players in our class) arranged our players’ roles in the team according to their different strengths and set everyone’s training goals, with the intention of diversifying the team by maximizing each individual’s strengths. Charlotte, for example, has excellent shooting ability and is one of the few girls with a high three-point shooting rate, but not a high profile. So I suppose her to be a quarterback, grabbing the scoring opportunities outside the free throw line. Secondly, Wang is fast and aggressive, with strong breakthrough ability. What’s more, she is fairly good at making up the rebound. So I suggest she should be a small forward and score for us in the area under the basket. Thirdly, as for me myself, I seldom practice shooting, but I am good at defending, passing and controlling the ball. Although I am short, I have the ability to steal and cap. So I recommend myself to be a big striker, doing a good job of passing, and limiting the scorer of the other side. As for the two substitutes, Anna is tall, capable and stealing, and has a natural advantage in grabbing rebounds. So she is the best choice to be a center. Emily’s shooting ability is so strong that she can be another quarterback who plays for Charlotte during Charlotte’s break. </p>
<p>However, I missed two points, which were the ones of the most important reasons we lost. First of all, my idea is too idealistic. We are an all-round team, but the other teams do not have such a detailed division of labour. I imagined other teams to be so formal that I thought they would be as well-equipped as we are, with conventional strategies. In the reality, however, the vast majority of women’s basketball teams in our grade don’t have a quarterback with great shooting ability, so they didn’t choose to attack from long range. In the end, they controlled the rebound and we lost even all the choices of holding the ball. Secondly, other teams chose to let each player develop different abilities, such as shooting, stealing, defense, attack and so on, precisely because each person’s ability is not outstanding. On the contrary, we ignored the training of disadvantages. The quarterback didn’t know how to defend, often ending up leaving the other side empty-handed; I never thought to shoot as a big forward and point guard. Here’s an example that can prove me wrong, where the quarterback actually didn’t get a chance to shoot in the final game and I was forced to shoot and scored for our team. </p>
<p>Second, engagement. This is the point where I like our team best. Every long breaking, noon, afternoon school, we went to the playground training. What’s more, I often invited the school team’s older brothers to guide us, also asked other team leaders to play training matches. As the whole school students know, our team will always started training every day the earliest, at the same time ended the latest. However, what they don’t know is that, after returning home, I would also send a summary of the daily training to the chat box, and we continued a heated discussion in the QQ group. </p>
<p>Third, energizing. I appreciate our team very much since the teammates are very warm and considerate. We bought each other drinks and snacks. We hugged each other when felt depressed. I also said a lot to encourage everyone before the game to build their confidence. </p>
<p>Fourth, enabling. I’m not the best player in the team, but I’m always keen to share what I’ve learned with my teammates. For instance, I would teach the teammates who weren’t good at defending how to observe the attackers, and I would also tell the center how to move to the best position. </p>
<p>Fifth, excellent execution. For myself, I watched a lot of short videos of NBA games to learn the skills of the basketball stars. At the same time, I surfed the Internet to consult a variety of information about strategies, and I asked around friends and predecessors who have a broad knowledge of basketball as will. </p>
<p>Sixth, persuading. During my communication with the teammates, parents, opponents, and schoolchites, I learned how to express my opinions and asks euphemistically, and I finally understood that the most important thing in a successful conversation is sincerity. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Recently I am doing research on programme study of physical sciences, social sciences, education and geography, which are my favorite subjects. In the following article I intend to discuss some of my ideas on them.</p>
<p><strong>【1】PHYSICAL NATURAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>This subject area concentrates a lot on discovering the interconnections between apparently discrete subjects, as the blurring of boundaries between the different sciences which all offer people a fundamental understanding of the way the universe works.<br>It acquires a lot of skills as well. Physics students always need to gain an insight into different scientific methods. To achieve this goal successfully, they need to develop their intellectual skills, such as critical thinking, analysis, problem-solving skills. During specific programs, they must use their research skills, including data management and analysis, critical analysis, specialist research methods.What’s more, communication and presentation skills also play an important role in their study, including written, oral, non-verbal. Organizational skills are often required in order to improve themselves, such as independent working, managing time. When cooperating with others, they need interpersonal skills, such as teamwork, negotiation, delegation, flexibility, adaptability. These various skills are highly valued by employers of all types, as a result they can be qualified for a range of jobs like teaching and researching at the very forefront of current scientific knowledge, tackling some of the most important challenges, research strengths, and successful academic collaborations and professional accreditation.<br>It is interesting to note that professors not only want their students to be someone have strong academic ability, but also wish them to become someone who progresses their area of science, someone with their own ideas and opinions who initiates rather than imitates.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【2】POLITICS, ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Politics student study how government work, how public policies are made, and also international relations. To study and practice, they write reports and essays, attend lectures and seminars, hear from politicians, go out to have placement and industry experience, and undertake data-analysis training. I also did some researches on the disciplinary major of Politics and History, as I’m quite interesting in it. This major links major disciplines in humanity and social science, provides historical context to your studies in political science, and also develops your transferable skills: intellectually rigorous arguments based on sound, independent research and analysis. Last but not least, I was a little bit worries that whether this subject is sensitive because of the various of political views and ideology. Fortunately, a teacher in Cambridge told my not to worry about that because in college we study it in an academic angle, not including our personal statements.<br>Economics student focus on how consumers, firms and government make decisions that collectively determine how resources are located, by make sense of governmental policy-making, the conduct of businesses and the enormous economic transformations throughout the world.</p>
<p>During my research I found it is quite interesting that Maths are always important in every social science subjects. Economics need statistics of course, and maths can also help us understand logic course in philosophy and theories in policies. To be honest, this discovery strengthened my determination to study mathematics &gt;-&lt;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【3】EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>One teacher in Cambridge taught me that if I want to apply for this major, I should think of the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>①Reason for applying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I was preparing for my entrance exam for the senior high schools, I realized the important roles that teachers and textbooks play on one kid’s study experiences. </li>
<li>I was influenced by my favorite philosopher and writer Rousseau and his book EMILE.</li>
<li>I am really interested in the combination of education and other social sciences such as sociology, philosophy and history.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>②Your advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve got lots of back ground information by reading various educational books.</li>
<li>I took part in several competitions of social science, such as NEC and IOL. I also did some researches myself or leaded by teachers.</li>
<li>I’m always willing to cooperate with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>③Further goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I want to do further researches after graduation. Also, doing interdisciplinary research in PHD study is very fascinating to me. </li>
<li>I want to be a writer of educational books or a educational policy maker.</li>
<li>I want to make some improvement in teaching methods, such as new ways of teaching like online teaching. Also, I want to improve the composition of textbooks, in order to make sure that students can learn new knowledge in a more comfortable and easy way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>④Prepared things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was among the top 400 students in my city in the entrance exam of senior high. I also won lots of prizes, such as the national first prize in IOL open round.</li>
<li>I am a vice president of a biology club, and I have organized plenty of activities successfully.</li>
<li>I am good at written work and making speeches. I came first in a speech competition in our grade and came second in another.</li>
<li>I had chance to taught younger student in my primary schools, and they were quite interested in the stories I shared with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>⑤Five important skills that I have</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>language skills- I am always confident about expressing ideas and making speeches.</li>
<li>academic skills- I have done lots of written work and further study on topics that I am interested in.</li>
<li>good temper- I am willing to express myself in logical and tactful ways, in order that other can understand me easily and pleasantly.</li>
<li>cooperation&amp;leadership</li>
<li>association&amp;imagination- I can respond quickly when contacting with new things. For instance, when I learn a new theory, I can always think of theories that I have learned in the past and connect them together.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>【4】GEOGRAPHY</strong></p>
<p>Geography students focus on all the biggest challenges in our planet, including globalization, environmental politics, urbanization, conservation, climate change, glaciation, volcanology, Quaternary Science, the future of developing regions, culture differences and even food security, social inequalities. There are two main branches, human geography which concentrates on how human activity affects the environment and physical geography which focus on physical features and phenomenon.</p>
<p>As geography is a science, there are several research skills quite important to this subjects. First, high learning efficiency in lectures, practices and field trips. Second, data collection( quantitative and qualitative), storage, processing, analysis, display and evaluation. Third, the use of geographical information system mapping, a significant tool which can be used in geographical research.</p>
<p>And for the question of how to apply for this subject area, here’s something that I can do nowadays. First of all, I should stay up to date with news and topical issues - these are also that geography students focus on. What’s more, books, blogs, podcasts, documentaries can be helpful. I can even volunteer in the nearby geographical museum! Last but not least, I can also take part in several essay competitions and debates to show that I am competitive and passionate.</p>

        <p>Last month I took the AMC exam, and the result was much worse than I thought. I intend to talk about the thoughts I came up with during preparation, the reason I failed and my point of view on the subject of mathematics.</p>
<p>First of all, I learned a lot during the preparation process. This time includes elementary algebra, basic geometry, elementary number theory, and combinatorial problems. It is theoretical and abstract, so it is necessary to work hard on the understanding of knowledge, think more and study more. In the process of mathematics learning, what was the most valuable to me was to understand the importance of correcting the mistakes, to analyze the reasons and correct answers, so as to find my weaknesses. From my perspective, constantly looking for the causes of small mistakes is the most important way to success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two reasons for the failure of the exam. First, as an international student, I haven’t connected the courses and examination methods at home and abroad well. In China, the majority of our scores are often answer questions and fill-in-the-blank questions, so I spent a lot of time calculating accurate results, while ignoring some unique methods for multiple-choice questions, such as inferring information from options. Secondly, because I was busy studying linguistics at the same time, I was not well prepared for this exam. I was neither familiar with all kinds of test sites and question types.</p>
<p>I made plans respectively in order to solve these problems. First, the first thing to do when attending a competition is always to understand the characteristics of the competition through the study of the introduction to the competition instead of meaningless blind preparation. Second, by doing exercises, you can become familiar with the question types and consolidate knowledge points, thereby enhancing the pertinence of learning and improving your ability more efficiently.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the subject of mathematics. Mathematics is a old subject with fairly long history, and I personally like it very much. We can infer its importance from the fact that it has been valued since ancient times. The reason why mathematics has an irreplaceable effect on human beings is because it is extremely effective for thinking training. In daily life, it can not only be used to calculate data, but also has a certain enlightenment on our way of solving problems. Learning mathematics makes our thinking ways more organized and logical. In addition, in the field of professional research, no matter whether it is social science or natural science, mathematics is needed as a foundation.</p>
<p>To sum up, I enjoy the process of learning mathematics, and also have the enthusiasm to learn it well.</p>

        <p><strong>PART 1 THE WINTER CAMP OF LINGUISTICS</strong></p>
<p>The IOL winter camp is over today. I have got a new understanding of linguistics in just four days of online training. Before studying linguistics, I thought that it as an unpredictable subject. However, after learning it, I discovered that it is actually closely related to our world. </p>
<p>We learned basic knowledge, such as phonetics, phonology, language family, semantics, morphology, syntax and so on. We also learned how to solve problems. The problem-solving process is like doing fieldwork – deciphering a new language.</p>
<p>I learned that languages are regular. I learned vowel, consonants and their different ways of pronunciation. I also studied the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is an outstanding contribution of linguists to the world. I learned about root affixes and the rules of word formation. At the same time, the teachers prepared many related questions for us. We analyzed the expression rules of these strange languages, and then infer the meaning of other compound words and sentences through the translations we already know.</p>
<p>In this study, I learned many new languages, which refreshed the world in my heart. I never expected that civilizations were so diverse. At the same time, in the summary of the language rules, I also found their unity. As a result, I can’t help but admire the magic of the world. In addition, during the process of analyzing, I also exercised my thinking ability. I find that I am more organized and can think more logically.</p>
<p>I believe that this winter camp will have a profound impact on my future research. Thanks to my teachers and teammates!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PART 2 LINGUISTICS &amp; IOL WITH ME</strong></p>
<p>I learned interpreting a long, long time ago. At that time, I was curious that each language could be converted to each other and the meanings were almost the same. After entering high school, I started to learn IELTS and learn German as a second foreign language. At this time I found that the language is indeed regular.</p>
<p>My undergraduate degree is hoped to be humanities and social sciences, and I am very passionate about ancient history. So during reading different materials, I found that people everywhere choose to worship the same things, such as the sun. I believe that this kind of human commonality, such as the reverence for nature and the consistency of other behaviors and actions, is the reason why some common semantics in different languages are often interlinked. In other words, there are few common meanings which we can find in one language but cannot find in other languages. Furthermore, I checked the origin of human language and found that although there are many controversies about it, they are all very interesting. They are inseparable from the discussion of the unity of culture.</p>
<p>The formal exposure to the subject of linguistics takes about two months. After knowing that a elder sister of NFLS was the last world champion, the impression of this subject to me has changed from unfamiliar to melodious. It just so happens that there are friends who love linguistics discussing some common points in different languages, which attracts me a lot. As a result, I signed up for this competition, planning to improve myself and make some like-minded friends at the same time.</p>
<p>In the process of preparing for the linguistics exam, I first participated in the linguistics winter camp. Through the introduction and explanation of the coaches, I became familiar with the subject, its examination content and thinking requirements. I organize the courseware of my coaches, make notes, and search the Internet for the knowledge points I don’t understand, or ask the professionals around me to help answer questions. Secondly, in my spare time, I also printed out the questions in the past year exams for practice, and became familiar with the method of doing the questions.     Last but not list, of course, my friends and I often discuss linguistic knowledge and briefly learn linguistic probability on the Internet platform.</p>
