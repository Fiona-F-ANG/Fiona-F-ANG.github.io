    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Recently I am doing research on programme study of physical sciences, social sciences, education and geography, which are my favorite subjects. In the following article I intend to discuss some of my ideas on them.</p>
<p><strong>【1】PHYSICAL NATURAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>This subject area concentrates a lot on discovering the interconnections between apparently discrete subjects, as the blurring of boundaries between the different sciences which all offer people a fundamental understanding of the way the universe works.<br>It acquires a lot of skills as well. Physics students always need to gain an insight into different scientific methods. To achieve this goal successfully, they need to develop their intellectual skills, such as critical thinking, analysis, problem-solving skills. During specific programs, they must use their research skills, including data management and analysis, critical analysis, specialist research methods.What’s more, communication and presentation skills also play an important role in their study, including written, oral, non-verbal. Organizational skills are often required in order to improve themselves, such as independent working, managing time. When cooperating with others, they need interpersonal skills, such as teamwork, negotiation, delegation, flexibility, adaptability. These various skills are highly valued by employers of all types, as a result they can be qualified for a range of jobs like teaching and researching at the very forefront of current scientific knowledge, tackling some of the most important challenges, research strengths, and successful academic collaborations and professional accreditation.<br>It is interesting to note that professors not only want their students to be someone have strong academic ability, but also wish them to become someone who progresses their area of science, someone with their own ideas and opinions who initiates rather than imitates.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【2】POLITICS, ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Politics student study how government work, how public policies are made, and also international relations. To study and practice, they write reports and essays, attend lectures and seminars, hear from politicians, go out to have placement and industry experience, and undertake data-analysis training. I also did some researches on the disciplinary major of Politics and History, as I’m quite interesting in it. This major links major disciplines in humanity and social science, provides historical context to your studies in political science, and also develops your transferable skills: intellectually rigorous arguments based on sound, independent research and analysis. Last but not least, I was a little bit worries that whether this subject is sensitive because of the various of political views and ideology. Fortunately, a teacher in Cambridge told my not to worry about that because in college we study it in an academic angle, not including our personal statements.<br>Economics student focus on how consumers, firms and government make decisions that collectively determine how resources are located, by make sense of governmental policy-making, the conduct of businesses and the enormous economic transformations throughout the world.</p>
<p>During my research I found it is quite interesting that Maths are always important in every social science subjects. Economics need statistics of course, and maths can also help us understand logic course in philosophy and theories in policies. To be honest, this discovery strengthened my determination to study mathematics &gt;-&lt;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【3】EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>One teacher in Cambridge taught me that if I want to apply for this major, I should think of the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>①Reason for applying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I was preparing for my entrance exam for the senior high schools, I realized the important roles that teachers and textbooks play on one kid’s study experiences. </li>
<li>I was influenced by my favorite philosopher and writer Rousseau and his book EMILE.</li>
<li>I am really interested in the combination of education and other social sciences such as sociology, philosophy and history.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>②Your advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve got lots of back ground information by reading various educational books.</li>
<li>I took part in several competitions of social science, such as NEC and IOL. I also did some researches myself or leaded by teachers.</li>
<li>I’m always willing to cooperate with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>③Further goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I want to do further researches after graduation. Also, doing interdisciplinary research in PHD study is very fascinating to me. </li>
<li>I want to be a writer of educational books or a educational policy maker.</li>
<li>I want to make some improvement in teaching methods, such as new ways of teaching like online teaching. Also, I want to improve the composition of textbooks, in order to make sure that students can learn new knowledge in a more comfortable and easy way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>④Prepared things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was among the top 400 students in my city in the entrance exam of senior high. I also won lots of prizes, such as the national first prize in IOL open round.</li>
<li>I am a vice president of a biology club, and I have organized plenty of activities successfully.</li>
<li>I am good at written work and making speeches. I came first in a speech competition in our grade and came second in another.</li>
<li>I had chance to taught younger student in my primary schools, and they were quite interested in the stories I shared with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>⑤Five important skills that I have</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>language skills- I am always confident about expressing ideas and making speeches.</li>
<li>academic skills- I have done lots of written work and further study on topics that I am interested in.</li>
<li>good temper- I am willing to express myself in logical and tactful ways, in order that other can understand me easily and pleasantly.</li>
<li>cooperation&amp;leadership</li>
<li>association&amp;imagination- I can respond quickly when contacting with new things. For instance, when I learn a new theory, I can always think of theories that I have learned in the past and connect them together.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>【4】GEOGRAPHY</strong></p>
<p>Geography students focus on all the biggest challenges in our planet, including globalization, environmental politics, urbanization, conservation, climate change, glaciation, volcanology, Quaternary Science, the future of developing regions, culture differences and even food security, social inequalities. There are two main branches, human geography which concentrates on how human activity affects the environment and physical geography which focus on physical features and phenomenon.</p>
<p>As geography is a science, there are several research skills quite important to this subjects. First, high learning efficiency in lectures, practices and field trips. Second, data collection( quantitative and qualitative), storage, processing, analysis, display and evaluation. Third, the use of geographical information system mapping, a significant tool which can be used in geographical research.</p>
<p>And for the question of how to apply for this subject area, here’s something that I can do nowadays. First of all, I should stay up to date with news and topical issues - these are also that geography students focus on. What’s more, books, blogs, podcasts, documentaries can be helpful. I can even volunteer in the nearby geographical museum! Last but not least, I can also take part in several essay competitions and debates to show that I am competitive and passionate.</p>

        <p>Last month I took the AMC exam, and the result was much worse than I thought. I intend to talk about the thoughts I came up with during preparation, the reason I failed and my point of view on the subject of mathematics.</p>
<p>First of all, I learned a lot during the preparation process. This time includes elementary algebra, basic geometry, elementary number theory, and combinatorial problems. It is theoretical and abstract, so it is necessary to work hard on the understanding of knowledge, think more and study more. In the process of mathematics learning, what was the most valuable to me was to understand the importance of correcting the mistakes, to analyze the reasons and correct answers, so as to find my weaknesses. From my perspective, constantly looking for the causes of small mistakes is the most important way to success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two reasons for the failure of the exam. First, as an international student, I haven’t connected the courses and examination methods at home and abroad well. In China, the majority of our scores are often answer questions and fill-in-the-blank questions, so I spent a lot of time calculating accurate results, while ignoring some unique methods for multiple-choice questions, such as inferring information from options. Secondly, because I was busy studying linguistics at the same time, I was not well prepared for this exam. I was neither familiar with all kinds of test sites and question types.</p>
<p>I made plans respectively in order to solve these problems. First, the first thing to do when attending a competition is always to understand the characteristics of the competition through the study of the introduction to the competition instead of meaningless blind preparation. Second, by doing exercises, you can become familiar with the question types and consolidate knowledge points, thereby enhancing the pertinence of learning and improving your ability more efficiently.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the subject of mathematics. Mathematics is a old subject with fairly long history, and I personally like it very much. We can infer its importance from the fact that it has been valued since ancient times. The reason why mathematics has an irreplaceable effect on human beings is because it is extremely effective for thinking training. In daily life, it can not only be used to calculate data, but also has a certain enlightenment on our way of solving problems. Learning mathematics makes our thinking ways more organized and logical. In addition, in the field of professional research, no matter whether it is social science or natural science, mathematics is needed as a foundation.</p>
<p>To sum up, I enjoy the process of learning mathematics, and also have the enthusiasm to learn it well.</p>

        <p><strong>PART 1 THE WINTER CAMP OF LINGUISTICS</strong></p>
<p>The IOL winter camp is over today. I have got a new understanding of linguistics in just four days of online training. Before studying linguistics, I thought that it as an unpredictable subject. However, after learning it, I discovered that it is actually closely related to our world. </p>
<p>We learned basic knowledge, such as phonetics, phonology, language family, semantics, morphology, syntax and so on. We also learned how to solve problems. The problem-solving process is like doing fieldwork – deciphering a new language.</p>
<p>I learned that languages are regular. I learned vowel, consonants and their different ways of pronunciation. I also studied the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is an outstanding contribution of linguists to the world. I learned about root affixes and the rules of word formation. At the same time, the teachers prepared many related questions for us. We analyzed the expression rules of these strange languages, and then infer the meaning of other compound words and sentences through the translations we already know.</p>
<p>In this study, I learned many new languages, which refreshed the world in my heart. I never expected that civilizations were so diverse. At the same time, in the summary of the language rules, I also found their unity. As a result, I can’t help but admire the magic of the world. In addition, during the process of analyzing, I also exercised my thinking ability. I find that I am more organized and can think more logically.</p>
<p>I believe that this winter camp will have a profound impact on my future research. Thanks to my teachers and teammates!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PART 2 LINGUISTICS &amp; IOL WITH ME</strong></p>
<p>I learned interpreting a long, long time ago. At that time, I was curious that each language could be converted to each other and the meanings were almost the same. After entering high school, I started to learn IELTS and learn German as a second foreign language. At this time I found that the language is indeed regular.</p>
<p>My undergraduate degree is hoped to be humanities and social sciences, and I am very passionate about ancient history. So during reading different materials, I found that people everywhere choose to worship the same things, such as the sun. I believe that this kind of human commonality, such as the reverence for nature and the consistency of other behaviors and actions, is the reason why some common semantics in different languages are often interlinked. In other words, there are few common meanings which we can find in one language but cannot find in other languages. Furthermore, I checked the origin of human language and found that although there are many controversies about it, they are all very interesting. They are inseparable from the discussion of the unity of culture.</p>
<p>The formal exposure to the subject of linguistics takes about two months. After knowing that a elder sister of NFLS was the last world champion, the impression of this subject to me has changed from unfamiliar to melodious. It just so happens that there are friends who love linguistics discussing some common points in different languages, which attracts me a lot. As a result, I signed up for this competition, planning to improve myself and make some like-minded friends at the same time.</p>
<p>In the process of preparing for the linguistics exam, I first participated in the linguistics winter camp. Through the introduction and explanation of the coaches, I became familiar with the subject, its examination content and thinking requirements. I organize the courseware of my coaches, make notes, and search the Internet for the knowledge points I don’t understand, or ask the professionals around me to help answer questions. Secondly, in my spare time, I also printed out the questions in the past year exams for practice, and became familiar with the method of doing the questions.     Last but not list, of course, my friends and I often discuss linguistic knowledge and briefly learn linguistic probability on the Internet platform.</p>
