    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Recently I am doing research on programme study of physical sciences, social sciences, education and geography, which are my favorite subjects. In the following article I intend to discuss some of my ideas on them.</p>
<p><strong>【1】PHYSICAL NATURAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>This subject area concentrates a lot on discovering the interconnections between apparently discrete subjects, as the blurring of boundaries between the different sciences which all offer people a fundamental understanding of the way the universe works.<br>It acquires a lot of skills as well. Physics students always need to gain an insight into different scientific methods. To achieve this goal successfully, they need to develop their intellectual skills, such as critical thinking, analysis, problem-solving skills. During specific programs, they must use their research skills, including data management and analysis, critical analysis, specialist research methods.What’s more, communication and presentation skills also play an important role in their study, including written, oral, non-verbal. Organizational skills are often required in order to improve themselves, such as independent working, managing time. When cooperating with others, they need interpersonal skills, such as teamwork, negotiation, delegation, flexibility, adaptability. These various skills are highly valued by employers of all types, as a result they can be qualified for a range of jobs like teaching and researching at the very forefront of current scientific knowledge, tackling some of the most important challenges, research strengths, and successful academic collaborations and professional accreditation.<br>It is interesting to note that professors not only want their students to be someone have strong academic ability, but also wish them to become someone who progresses their area of science, someone with their own ideas and opinions who initiates rather than imitates.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【2】POLITICS, ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Politics student study how government work, how public policies are made, and also international relations. To study and practice, they write reports and essays, attend lectures and seminars, hear from politicians, go out to have placement and industry experience, and undertake data-analysis training. I also did some researches on the disciplinary major of Politics and History, as I’m quite interesting in it. This major links major disciplines in humanity and social science, provides historical context to your studies in political science, and also develops your transferable skills: intellectually rigorous arguments based on sound, independent research and analysis. Last but not least, I was a little bit worries that whether this subject is sensitive because of the various of political views and ideology. Fortunately, a teacher in Cambridge told my not to worry about that because in college we study it in an academic angle, not including our personal statements.<br>Economics student focus on how consumers, firms and government make decisions that collectively determine how resources are located, by make sense of governmental policy-making, the conduct of businesses and the enormous economic transformations throughout the world.</p>
<p>During my research I found it is quite interesting that Maths are always important in every social science subjects. Economics need statistics of course, and maths can also help us understand logic course in philosophy and theories in policies. To be honest, this discovery strengthened my determination to study mathematics &gt;-&lt;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>【3】EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>One teacher in Cambridge taught me that if I want to apply for this major, I should think of the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>①Reason for applying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I was preparing for my entrance exam for the senior high schools, I realized the important roles that teachers and textbooks play on one kid’s study experiences. </li>
<li>I was influenced by my favorite philosopher and writer Rousseau and his book EMILE.</li>
<li>I am really interested in the combination of education and other social sciences such as sociology, philosophy and history.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>②Your advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve got lots of back ground information by reading various educational books.</li>
<li>I took part in several competitions of social science, such as NEC and IOL. I also did some researches myself or leaded by teachers.</li>
<li>I’m always willing to cooperate with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>③Further goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I want to do further researches after graduation. Also, doing interdisciplinary research in PHD study is very fascinating to me. </li>
<li>I want to be a writer of educational books or a educational policy maker.</li>
<li>I want to make some improvement in teaching methods, such as new ways of teaching like online teaching. Also, I want to improve the composition of textbooks, in order to make sure that students can learn new knowledge in a more comfortable and easy way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>④Prepared things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was among the top 400 students in my city in the entrance exam of senior high. I also won lots of prizes, such as the national first prize in IOL open round.</li>
<li>I am a vice president of a biology club, and I have organized plenty of activities successfully.</li>
<li>I am good at written work and making speeches. I came first in a speech competition in our grade and came second in another.</li>
<li>I had chance to taught younger student in my primary schools, and they were quite interested in the stories I shared with them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>⑤Five important skills that I have</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>language skills- I am always confident about expressing ideas and making speeches.</li>
<li>academic skills- I have done lots of written work and further study on topics that I am interested in.</li>
<li>good temper- I am willing to express myself in logical and tactful ways, in order that other can understand me easily and pleasantly.</li>
<li>cooperation&amp;leadership</li>
<li>association&amp;imagination- I can respond quickly when contacting with new things. For instance, when I learn a new theory, I can always think of theories that I have learned in the past and connect them together.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>【4】GEOGRAPHY</strong></p>
<p>Geography students focus on all the biggest challenges in our planet, including globalization, environmental politics, urbanization, conservation, climate change, glaciation, volcanology, Quaternary Science, the future of developing regions, culture differences and even food security, social inequalities. There are two main branches, human geography which concentrates on how human activity affects the environment and physical geography which focus on physical features and phenomenon.</p>
<p>As geography is a science, there are several research skills quite important to this subjects. First, high learning efficiency in lectures, practices and field trips. Second, data collection( quantitative and qualitative), storage, processing, analysis, display and evaluation. Third, the use of geographical information system mapping, a significant tool which can be used in geographical research.</p>
<p>And for the question of how to apply for this subject area, here’s something that I can do nowadays. First of all, I should stay up to date with news and topical issues - these are also that geography students focus on. What’s more, books, blogs, podcasts, documentaries can be helpful. I can even volunteer in the nearby geographical museum! Last but not least, I can also take part in several essay competitions and debates to show that I am competitive and passionate.</p>
