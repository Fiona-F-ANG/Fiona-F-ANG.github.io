        <p>Authors use the geographic perspective when crafting novels, stories, or other works of fiction. The relationship between people and their natural and constructed environments is often a key part of a story’s plot, theme, or setting. In some books, there will be a large number of descriptions of the natural environment, some books are even based on the exploration of nature as a plot clue. Deeply fascinated by these books, I would like to explore their individual and common features, and how their authors express clearly and perfectly through words about those shocking and touching themes they want to share. </p>
<p>I read two novels during the summer holiday, both of which are closely related to geography. Personally I consider them as typical of geography novels. In the following paragraphs, I would like to share my views on the two books, attempting to sum up the common features of novels of this kind. </p>
<h1 id="I-Earth-Science-Novels"><a href="#I-Earth-Science-Novels" class="headerlink" title="I.Earth Science Novels"></a><strong>I.Earth Science Novels</strong></h1><p>To begin with, I re-read Jules Verne’s Trilogy( <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth, Around the World in Eighty Days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas</em>) - it is also them which were my earth science initiation reads that left a lasting impression on me. They are the typical of novels related to earth science, including adventure, science fiction, etc. Apparently, these compositions are characterised by a combination of imagination and modern science, and to some reflect reality to a certain extent. </p>
<p>①First of all, they were written under a background of the Second Industrial Revolution and colonial expansion, backed up by enormous industrial achievements, which, combined with Mr Verne’s magnificent imagination, <strong>made these works both realistic and prophetic of the future.</strong> For instance, before Verne, a few authors had already tried writing subterranean fictions. However, thanks to his thorough study of Victorian science, Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> is considered as an outstanding one among all this type of book – his concept of a prehistoric realm (which is going to be introduced in detail in the following paragraph) still existing in the present-day world.</p>
<p>Another example of <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas</em> is quoted from Wikipedia, which I found as a persuasive evidence for my argument: the diving gear used by passengers on the Nautilus is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the surface-supplied hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865. Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand regulator. The diver didn’t swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an aérophore (Greek for “air-carrier”). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: “The Nautilus’s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure … my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.” </p>
<p>②Second, Verne refers to many achievements of the Industrial Revolution and natural science research in his works, and integrates these esoteric inventive principles into the colorful storyline, <strong>making the extensive study of natural sciences live and popularize</strong>. For example, in <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, there is a genuine underground world which is filled by a deep subterranean ocean, and surrounded by a rocky coastline that’s covered with petrified tree trunks, the fossils of prehistoric mammals, and gigantic living mushrooms. At the same time, in the book, Verne discuss the possibility of reaching the center of the earth, basing on theories. He also introduced the protagonists to a variety of geological knowledge during the ‘journey’, including rocks and rock formations, pressure, volcanoes and so on. </p>
<p>③Third, from the perspective of plot, these compositions are often about travel and adventure, which is inseparable from the influence of the Great Navigation Age. The protagonists’ courage to take risks, pioneer the wilderness, and conquer nature has inspired generations of readers, and is also what moved me most when I was a child. </p>
<p>The characters in the novel have their own characteristics. For instance, Nemo in <em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em> is an eccentric, knowledgeable, calm and resourceful captain; Professor Aronnax has a great passion for scientific inquiry; while the whaler Nederland has a fiery and straightforward temperament. In <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, there is Professor Otto Lidenbrock, a hot-tempered geologist with radical ideas; Axel, a cautious young student; and Hans Bjelke, their resourceful and imperturbable guide. In <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em>, the British gentleman Mr. Falk is as cool as a cucumber – despite the difficulties encountered during the journey, he never complains.<br>Besides the personalities, they also have a lot in common. First of all, they are very humanitarian and attach great importance to friendship. Mr. Falk spent a lot of precious time saving unknown women and insignificant servants, who also helped him later. Captain Nemo wrestles with sharks to rescue pearl divers; he also tearfully buries his dead companion under the reef. What’s more, they all have a strong spirit of exploration and have always adhered to their beliefs. Even if goals seem impossible to achieve, they never give up. </p>
<p>④Last but not least, social systems, the side effects of the Industrial Revolution, political revolution, etc. were also mentioned in these compostions, that is Verne attempting to provoke people to reflect on the society. Of course, as popular science writer, he used more descriptive than evaluation or satire, in order to present social reality to readers. The most impressive examply is the true identity of Captain Nemo, which was revealed in Verne’s later novel, <em>The Mysterious Land</em>. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was ultimately quashed by the British. After his family were killed by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas.</p>
<h1 id="II-Human-Geography-Novels"><a href="#II-Human-Geography-Novels" class="headerlink" title="II. Human Geography Novels"></a><strong>II. Human Geography Novels</strong></h1><p>The second book I read was Chi Zijian’s “<em>The Right Bank of the Erguna River</em>.”(额尔古纳河右岸) This is a representative of a humanistic and geographical novel. With a 90-year-old Evenk woman recountig her life experience, the book reflects the development of the Evenk people in the past hundred years. This nation lived in the forest, survived under the grace and torture of nature, suffered from Japan’s invasion and experienced the Cultural Revolution. Under the “invasion” of civilization, they had to wander between nomadism and settlement. With a calm and gentle style and ethereal language, Chi Zijian recreates for us the hundred-year persistence of and cultural changes experienced by the Evenk people. </p>
<p>Many people say that this work is an epic elegy of a nation, while personally I think that it is also an elegy about a certain kind of wonderful life, an elegy about a certain kind of values and ways of life of human beings. In the book, people look up at the sky, indulge in rivers and mountains, fear the gods in their hearts, sing simple songs, born in the “sound of the wind”, and finally buried in the wind. In addition to the image as the main character, what is more moving is the changing white clouds, the twinkling starlight, the Shilen Pillar that allow people to see the sky, the reindeer, the moon, the shaman’s dance, the birch and pine trees, and the bright flowing water…… They are not only the background and basis of the characters’ lives, but also the other protagonists in the book. Together, they constitute a beautiful and fragile world, a mixture of joy and suffering, of sadness and happiness. </p>
<p>I greatly appreciate Ms. Chi Zijian’s writing, her way of expression is pure and gentle, as quiet as the snow in the north, integrating with the story she depicts. I think it’s especially important for a human geography or cultural writer to practice a narrative that has its own characteristics. Of course, as just mentioned, the description of the natural environment in the book makes this novel even more gripping. </p>
<p>Interestingly, there are comments on the Internet that this book is very similar to Márquez’s “<em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>“, which is also a book that I have always been willing to appreciate. It writes about the faces of the mountains, rivers, seas, continents, animals, plants, religious peoples and peoples of the Latin American. Through the fictionalization of the century-long rise and fall of a family, it integrates historical reality and fantasy, interprets the history and destiny of Colombia and even the entire Latin American continent for a century in an epic and magnificent way. In the colorful giant picture, there are not only incredible miracles, but also purest real life. From my perspective, I consider these two books as both the pinnacle of the geographical novels and the jewel of human literature as a whole. </p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>To summarise, all geography-related novels <strong>closely combine their plot with the depiction of the natural environment</strong>. Through popular science novels, readers can appreciate <strong>a lot of science and technology</strong>; in cultural novels, there are a great number of <strong>descriptions of society and characters’ mind</strong>. These novels all discuss the <strong>relationship between man and nature, inspiring our enthusiasm for exploring nature or gratitude for it.</strong> They also <strong>look down on human civilization from the perspective of nature</strong>, which not only gives readers a refreshing reading experience, but also provokes us to think deeply.</p>
